On the afternoon of May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, was in the process of being arrested for allegedly passing a counterfeit bill. Mr. Floyd showed no signs of violently resisting arrest, but he was pinned to the ground anyway. Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes. Even after he slipped into unconsciousness and paramedics were on scene, he remained on Mr. Floyd’s neck. Floyd died later that evening. He wasn’t striking out against the officers. He had not been officially charged with any crime, so why did he deserve to die? (_New York Times_)

There is a problem in this nation: implicit bias and systemic racism amongst police officers has led to the deaths of people of color. A problem most clearly stated by a study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that in the United States, “Among all groups, Black men and boys face the highest lifetime risk of being killed by police. Our models predict that about 1 in 1,000 Black men and boys will be killed by police over... life.” This is 2.5 times that of white men and boys.

  
One may argue that this is because areas where people of color live have higher crime rates. However, according to the Sentencing Project, a prison reform advocacy group working out of Washington, DC, “\[s\]ince many crimes go unreported to the police, it is difficult to draw conclusions about race with respect to who offends. The most reliable statistics available are arrest data… but these figures omit those who committed an offense but were not arrested.”

A cadet of color told me about a conversation he had with his father about how police would treat him. This young man is a morally upstanding model citizen and a high achieving student, whose father’s personal experience told him that he would need to be on guard to avoid ending up like Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, or George Floyd. I, as a white student, cannot even imagine what it would be like to have to have this conversation.

Given these arguments, I do not want to be misconstrued. I am not saying all cops are horrible racists, but what I am saying is that the relationship between communities of color and law enforcement is a historically broken one, and I am proposing that we fundamentally change both the role of police officers and the way the community interacts with them.

Let’s first address the problem of race. Implicit bias training certainly is beneficial to officers, but it does not completely solve the problem at hand. Racism has never been a silver bullet subject. “Researchers have found that greater diversity in police departments and local government boosts trust in those institutions in nonwhite neighborhoods,” reports Lauren Leatherby and Richard Oppel of the _New York Times_. Unfortunately, much like implicit bias training, it isn’t perfect but it is a large step in the right direction. Training like this can be augmented by de-escalation training. This training isn’t just focused on racial bias, but also bringing the temperature of dangerous situations down. The Las Vegas police department has been at the forefront of this training, and has seen great success. Sgt. Brian Briggs of the LVPD described the purpose of the training to the Chicago tribune, “\[w\]e are trying to tell people it's OK, we have more time... There were too many incidents, too many shootings, too many even uses of force. People were saying we need to come up with a new way of thinking about it."

The second central piece to changing police and community relations is the demilitarization of police. A report published by the ACLU stated, “\[o\]ur neighborhoods are not warzones, and police officers should not be treating us like wartime enemies… yet every year, billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment flows from the federal government to state and local police departments.” A study done by a group of social and political experts had this conclusion on the transfer of military equipment to law enforcement: “the receipt of more military equipment increases both the expected number of civilians killed by police.” Quite simply put, when anyone is given the weapons of a soldier, it will lead to them acting more aggressively both because of the power wielded by such equipment and the logical step that if they get these weapons of war they must be endangered.

We have a clear problem. There exists a racial disparity in the way America is policed. Here is a solution. Increasing knowledge about implicit racism and having police departments reflect their community. In addition, we must limit the militarization of police, so as to see them as members of a community and not as an invading force. This means recruiting from within the community and not from the suburbs.

We must seek to understand what we don’t understand. We must have the conversations about race that make us uncomfortable. We are the future police officers and leading citizens, so we must dispel this toxic American racial narrative.
