Over the past few years, it seems as if a minimal yet growing belief has now taken a firm root in American society: the police are systemically racist.

The idea that there is systemic police racism is a false idea. The notion that most police officers across the country are racist is also not true. In fact, statistics show that the majority of police officers are not racist, and race is not a motivating factor in policing.

That being said, incidents of police misconduct deserve unequivocal condemnation and accountability for those involved. However, it is important to remember that these anecdotal incidents are not representative of all police officers nationwide, the vast majority of whom are good, hardworking people who want to protect their communities. Time and again we have seen police officers do heroic things for the safety of their communities.

According to Heather MacDonald for the Wall Street Journal, “In 2015 a Justice Department analysis of the Philadelphia Police Department found that police officers were less likely than black or Hispanic officers to shoot unarmed black suspects.” In addition, “a ‘deadly force’ lab study at Washington State University by researcher Lois James found that participants were biased in favor of black suspects, over white or Hispanic ones, in simulated threat scenarios,” according to the same article.

Regardless of position, broadly generalizing a large group of people will not create peace in communities. Can we prove that every day police officers go out to act on racial impulses? I believe most people are willing to stand up in protest of overtly racist behavior. However, the act of racism must be specific and defined, not just the possibility of a thought in a person’s head.

The solution to changing perceptions of police is one of changing hearts and minds. We have to show that police officers are not the enemy. We all have to work together to have police officers establish better trust and relationships within their communities, so they can better be a part of the solution of stopping crime and violence everywhere.

Anti-law enforcement rhetoric was a massive part of fueling violence across the country this summer. The sad part is that none of this is conducive to actually creating wishful policy goals. If we are to create any policy changes, we must all respectfully come to the table. Obviously, not every person is advocating for violence or saying we should defund the police; however, if all we do is broadly call police officers racist, there is much less of an open environment and opportunity to actually talk about positive change.

According to research analyzed by the City Journal, with more police there will be less crime overall. As cities across the country “defund the police,” more crime will happen as a result. That will not make communities safer or more peaceful. Furthermore, after significant cuts to its police department this summer, the Minneapolis City Council recently approved over $6 million in funding to hire additional police officers after more than 200 officers left the force this summer.

If there is anything we can take from all of this it is that the key to police reform will be to help officers have stronger ties to their communities. These brave men and women deserve our support as they put themselves on the line every day to protect us. When an officer crosses the line, accountability is required, but broadly calling police officers racist or cutting their funding is not going to make anyone safer. We must back the blue and help build better, safer communities.
